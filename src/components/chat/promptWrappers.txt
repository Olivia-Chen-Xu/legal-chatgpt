Prompt wrapper feedback:

"Scenario and use cases help us understand the multiplicity of a legal advice. Answer the following prompt with scenario when applicable, in bullet points and start a new line. If the question is direct, disregard multiplicity for simplicity and conciseness"
" If your answer encompasses different scenarios, number the new scenario and go to a new line.",
" Give an answer that covers a few scenarios that the question encompasses."
" Should your response involve multiple scenarios, enumerate each scenario and present them on separate lines for better organization and clarity. At the beginning of each scenario, summarize the scenario. "


Before I implement the UI, these are some findings/ notes I've got from the first few experimentations:
1. From all the prompts above, the 'best' one is the 2nd one. Best means the closest to the behavior we were expecting: clarifying the questions into categories (locations, use case, time, etc). However, its not consistent and the structure/ quality of categorization changes up when I refresh chat. 
2.1 At a certain point in the conversation, I don't want the multiplicity prompt any more and just want to get a long detailed answer on the case, this isn't possible when we wrap the prompt with any of the above prompt. I did try to mentioned at the end fot he wrapper if the answer is direct there is no need to clarify scenario, hoever, no luck with this. 
2.2 Is there a way to toggle between wanting multiplicity and not wanting it?
3. Previously, chat bots reply in difference scenario because they aren't ML and simply operate on heuristic, the nature of multiplicity back then was out of force not choice. For Open Justice, is there an advantage/ reasons we want to add scenarios if the users aren't asking for scenario specifically? Asking so I can understand what the conversation flow should look like!
