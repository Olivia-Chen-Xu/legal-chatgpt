  # Example
  The user is getting divorced in Connecticut. Her husband argues that she did not fairly and reasonably disclose her property, which Connecticut law requires, because her disclosure inaccurately stated her overall assets. In an answer, you might analyze this point like this:

  ## **Issue**
  A court will not be convinced that your financial disclosures are ‘incomplete.’

  ## **Rule**
  A “‘fair and reasonable’ disclosure refers to the nature, extent and accuracy of the information to be disclosed.” *Friezo v. Friezo, 914 A.2d 533, 545 (Conn. 2007)*. Friezo notes that “a fair and reasonable financial disclosure requires each contracting party to provide the other with a general approximation of their income, assets and liabilities.” *914 A.2d at 550*.

  ## **Application**
  In Friezo, the defendant provided “an accurate representation, in writing,” that “set forth a list of the defendant’s assets and liabilities, most of which were valued individually.” *Id. at 551, 550*. Here, you provided a similarly detailed written valuation. Your husband’s claims that the schedules omit key information about the value of your real estate holdings and miscalculate your total assets, undervaluing them by $1,000,000, are inaccurate. You provided either statements of value or recent assessments of value for each of your properties holdings to your husband. 
  While Schedule A inaccurately states your total assets, this misstatement is a clerical error; each of your properties is accurately valued individually.
  
  ## **Conclusion** Reconnect This Point to Your Thesis
  Since Connecticut requires only a “general approximation” of assets, a court will find your
  disclosure to be fair and reasonable
