  "summary": {
    "abstract": "The appellant, a 30‐year employee and former manager, appeals the trial judge’s decision upholding his dismissal for cause following an incident where he slapped a female co‐worker on her buttocks. He disputes key factual findings – namely, that the contact was intentional and that his apologies lacked sincerity – and contends that the dismissal was not justified. In addition, he argues he is entitled to statutory benefits under the Employment Standards Act (ESA) and punitive damages for alleged litigation misconduct.",
    "outcome": "Appeal dismissed regarding wrongful dismissal and punitive damages; allowed regarding ESA entitlement (award of eight weeks’ termination pay) and costs (costs award set aside).",
    "verdict": "Dismissed on the main grounds of wrongful dismissal and punitive damages; allowed on the ESA entitlement and costs issues.",
    "recommendations": "No costs of trial are to be awarded; appellant to receive eight weeks’ termination pay."
