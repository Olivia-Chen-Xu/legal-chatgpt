    "abstract": "This case concerns an application to determine rights arising from an employment contract, specifically the enforceability of the termination clause and the consequent entitlement to common law notice.

    "verdict": "The entire termination clause is invalid because it breaches the Employment Standards Act, thereby entitling the applicant to common law notice and associated damages.",
    "recommendations": "The decision recommends that termination clauses must be drafted with clear language that complies with the ESA and that any ambiguity be interpreted in favor of the employee."
